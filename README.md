The **greyhypotheses** repositories are **repositories of notes & explorations**; almost all the projects I have been involved in are private, hence most project details cannot be shared.  The repositories are grouped by topic or [theme](https://github.com/theartificialintelligenceunit) via distinct *GitHub Organizations*.
